## Naive Bees

Here the goal is to create a classifier that automatically detects honey bees and bumble bees from images in python. There are three parts to this project:

### 1. 
Exploring the data: loading, transforming and understanding the images of honey bees and bumble bees;

### 2.
Building a model that automatically detects honey bees and bumble bees from images; and

### 3. 
Building a deep learning model that automatically detects honey bees and bumble bees from images.

This problem was a competition by Driven Data: [Naive Bees Classifier](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/8/)
The project is part of DataCamp, and here I am sharing my results after completing the project.
